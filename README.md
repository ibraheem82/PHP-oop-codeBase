## 1. Getting Started with Object Oriented Programming

Learn the fundamental concepts of OOP, including classes, objects, and basic principles to build a solid foundation in PHP OOP.

## 2. Construct and Destruct in PHP

Explore the constructor and destructor methods in PHP, understanding their roles in object initialization and cleanup.

## 3. Inheritance in PHP

Understand how to use inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes, promoting code reuse and organization.

## 4. Access Modifiers or Visibility in PHP

Explore access modifiers to control the visibility of properties and methods within classes.

## 5. Overriding in PHP

Learn how to override methods in child classes, allowing for customization and flexibility in your code.

## 6. Abstraction in PHP

Implement abstract classes and methods to define a blueprint for classes, promoting code structure and consistency.

## 7. Interfaces in PHP

Discover how to use interfaces to define a contract for classes, facilitating code design and interoperability.

## 8. Late Static Bindings in PHP

Explore late static bindings to reference the called class in a static context, enhancing code flexibility.

## 9. Traits in PHP

Understand traits and how they enable horizontal code reuse, allowing the composition of classes without using inheritance.

## 10. Type Hinting in PHP

Learn the importance of type hinting to enforce the data type of parameters and return values in PHP.

## 11. Anonymous Classes in PHP

Discover the use of anonymous classes to create on-the-fly objects without explicitly defining a class.

## 12. Comparing Objects in PHP

Explore techniques for comparing objects in PHP, understanding when and how to use comparison operators.

## 13. Magic Methods in PHP

Understand the concept of magic methods and how they provide functionality to handle specific actions within classes.

## 14. Magic Constants

Learn about magic constants in PHP, providing information about the script and its environment.

## 15. Namespaces in PHP

Explore namespaces to organize and encapsulate classes, preventing naming conflicts in large codebases.

## 16. Enumerations in PHP

Discover how to use enumerations to represent a fixed set of named values in PHP.

## 17. Exceptions in PHP

Learn about handling exceptions in PHP to gracefully manage errors and unexpected situations in your code.

## 18. Method Chaining

Understand the concept of method chaining to create more expressive and concise code by chaining multiple method calls.

## 19. Properties in PHP

Explore different types of properties in PHP classes, including static properties and constants.

## 20. Static

Learn about static methods and properties in PHP, understanding their use cases and implications in OOP.

Feel free to dive into each topic to enhance your understanding of PHP OOP concepts. Happy coding!
